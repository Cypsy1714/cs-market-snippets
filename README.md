# CS Trading Bot

A specialized CS trading system demonstrating mastery of Steam's inventory and trading APIs through bot account management and integration of different CS marketplaces synchronously.

## Project Overview

This trading bot showcases the expertise required for CS marketplace backend operations. It implements complete bot account management through Steam's inventory and trading APIs with real-time trade status tracking. The system maintains consistent item state across multiple marketplaces while handling the entire trade lifecycle from offer creation through confirmation and error handling.

## Technical Implementation

The core implementation includes robust data models that track item status across Steam inventory and marketplace listings. The Steam API client provides reliable access to inventory and trading endpoints, while market handlers ensure synchronized item status across different platforms. The advanced networking layer maintains reliable marketplace connections despite anti-bot measures.

My technical expertise includes experience operating automated Steam accounts with full inventory control and precise tracking of trade lock periods. The system prevents duplicate sales through reliable cross-marketplace synchronization and includes comprehensive handling of trade errors, declines, and timeouts.

## Specialized Trading Capabilities

The cross-platform coordination system updates item status in real-time across all connected platforms, automatically removing listings when an item sells elsewhere. It reliably tracks trade offers initiated by marketplace platforms and implements sophisticated error recovery for edge cases where trades fail or are cancelled, guaranteeing prevention of duplicate or falsely tracked sales.

## Backend Integration Expertise

My implementation shows expertise in creating stable, fault-tolerant API request systems with deep understanding of Steam's session based authentication. The system shows knowledge of marketplace security measures through successful circumvention techniques and advanced proxy management for reliable API connections.

## Why I'm the Ideal Candidate

This project demonstrates specialized knowledge that most developers lack. I've built a proven system for maintaining accurate item status across multiple platforms with comprehensive handling of all edge cases in the Steam trading process. My experience operating and maintaining Steam bot accounts has given me insight into the precise requirements for a reliable CS marketplace backend.

My system prevents and handles the critical failures that many marketplaces suffer from, through sophisticated status tracking and trade failure protection. This expertise is directly applicable to building robust P2P or bot marketplace infrastructure where reliability is the top priority.

Unlike general web developers, I understand the specific security requirements and technical challenges of the CS trading ecosystem from both implementation and circumvention perspectives, making me uniquely qualified to build secure, reliable marketplace systems.
