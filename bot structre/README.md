## Core Data Modeling & Market Representation

- **Multi-Market Data Abstraction**: Implementation of a unified type system that normalizes data across 8+ different CS marketplaces (CSMoney, BitSkins, CSFloat, etc.)
  
- **Item State Management**: Comprehensive state machine implementation for CS:GO items, tracking 12+ different states across the trading lifecycle

- **Inventory Tracking System**: Real-time tracking of item availability, offers, and trade-lock status to enable parallel market operations

- **Cross-Market ID Management**: Expertise in managing marketplace-specific identifiers for the same item across different platforms

- **Trade History Tracking**: Robust historical transaction data structures to inform pricing algorithms and profit calculations

This implementation demonstrates knowledge and experience of CS's complex marketplace ecosystem and the ability to design robust data models that work reliably in the CS items ecosystem.


## Arbitrage Detection & Pricing Algorithm

- **Dynamic Pricing**: Advanced pricing strategy that adjusts based on hold duration, market volatility, and historical sale data

- **Commission Analysis**: Mathematical calculations for true profit after accounting for all marketplace specific fees across the buy-sell operations

- **Trade Hold Optimization**: Algorithms that calculate price premiums based on different trade hold durations (2/4/7 days) to maximize profit

This price function implementation demonstrates analysis skills and the ability to build complex decision systems that operate reliably in volatile market conditions, consistently identifying profitable trading opportunities while managing risk.
